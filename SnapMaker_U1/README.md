## Snapmaker U1 Dashboard ##

When I had my Bambu A1 Mini printer, someone had a Home Assistant plugin that showed all kinds of status information about my printer.  Since then, I have upgraded to the Snapmaker U1 printer and I was longing for a good HA plugin, that would give me (almost) the same information that my Bambu did.
